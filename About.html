		<h1>Common Exercises</h1>
		<p>The following are common exercises that we encourage our clients to do as part of their daily exercise routine.</p>
		<dl>
			<dt>Burpee</dt>
			<dd>Burpees are a great, full body exercise to increase your strength and endurance. Begin in a standing position, drop into a squat and extend your hands forward, kick your feet back and then forward again quickly, and then jump up from a squatted position. </dd>

			<dt>Plank</dt>
			<dd>Planks build up your core strength. To perform a plank, get into a pushup position and rest your forearms on the floor. Hold the position as long as you can.</dd>

			<dt>Mountain Climbers</dt>
			<dd>MC are a good cardio exercise. Place your hands on the floor in a push up position, then bring one knee up to your chest aand then switch as quickly as you can (as though you are climbing a mountain). </dd>
